# No-Repeats
This script scans all files within a specified directory and its subdirectories to detect duplicate files. 
For example, if you point it to your Downloads folder, it will compare each file against the others in that folder and its subfolders to identify any duplicates.
This tool is designed for those who frequently download large amounts of 'Homework.' As your collection grows, managing and protecting against duplicate files can become increasingly challenging. This script helps you efficiently identify and eliminate duplicates, ensuring your files remain organized and clutter-free.
